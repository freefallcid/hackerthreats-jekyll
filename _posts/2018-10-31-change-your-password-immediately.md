Hey there, I got a quick update today. Now it looks like the domain pays itself :)
Hopefully I get a shitload of those scum mails the last days of my domain ownership.

<!-- You might know, the domain `prince-of-darkness.org` will only receive those mails
until November 12<sup><small>th</small></sup>. I will not renew it after that.

## Now let's move on with that blackmail scum

I have bad news for you.
06/28/2018 - on this day I hacked your operating system and got full access to your account child@death.prince-of-darkness.org
On that day your account (child@death.prince-of-darkness.org) password was: *********

It is useless to change the password, my malware intercepts it every time.

How it was:
In the software of the router to which you were connected that day, there was a vulnerability.
I first hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it.
When you entered in the Internet, my trojan was installed on the operating system of your device.

After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts).

A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a small amount of money to unlock.
But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and came to the big delight of your favorite resources.
I'm talking about sites for adults.

I want to say - you are a big pervert. You have unbridled fantasy!

After that, an idea came to my mind.
I made a screenshot of the intimate website where you have fun (you know what it is about, right?).
After that, I took off your joys (using the camera of your device). It turned out beautifully, do not hesitate.

I am strongly belive that you would not like to show these pictures to your relatives, friends or colleagues.
I think $968 is a very small amount for my silence.
Besides, I spent a lot of time on you!

I accept money only in Bitcoins.
My BTC wallet: 15ZHnf1MPn6ybb8yUeAoCQ1AJtiKhg3NrP

You do not know how to replenish a Bitcoin wallet?
In any search engine write "how to send money to btc wallet".
It's easier than send money to a credit card!

For payment you have a little more than two days (exactly 50 hours).
Do not worry, the timer will start at the moment when you open this letter. Yes, yes .. it has already started!

After payment, my virus and dirty photos with you self-destruct automatically.
Narrative, if I do not receive the specified amount from you, then your device will be blocked, and all your contacts will receive a photos with your "joys".

I want you to be prudent.
- Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data is already uploaded to a remote server)
- Do not try to contact me (this is not feasible, I sent you an email from your account)
- Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either, since your data is already on a remote server.

P.S. I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment, as you are not my single victim.
This is a hacker code of honor.

From now on, I advise you to use good antiviruses and update them regularly (several times a day)!

Don't be mad at me, everyone has their own work.
Farewell.</code></pre>

## A closer look at it

With some selected replies of me.

Don't worry, they are not as bad as you think. In fact, they are good news. Because on 06/28/2018 that account was physically not online. It's unpossible to infect what is not there.

> It is useless to change the password, my malware intercepts it every time.

It's not only useless -- it is not possible to change something that has nothing to change.
Or did you already ate an apple that did not exist? I guess not.

Now, move to the interesting part of that email:

Holy shit. I thought I'd see that only in movies, but your phantasies gone crazy on you right?  
Sorry, I had to interrupt writing in place of laughing. Laughing is good for life you know.

Oh cool, the last blackmail scumbags only gave me 48 hours. Damn I love you. Oh damn, but you already started the counter :(

So my device gets blocked. Blocked from your spam-list? That would be great bro!

> P.S. I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment, as you are not my single victim.  
> This is a hacker code of honor.

Lolz. Sorry, I have to laugh. Very loud. Out. Lol. You pathetic piece of shit. Seriously, get a real job and stop
fucking around with people. Once you fuck the wrong guy, you're life would be worth less that a little fly's shit.

A hacker code of honor. Lol. Out of a script-kiddies mouth. Hahahaha. Sorry, it is too much fun to handly properly.

> From now on, I advise you to use good antiviruses and update them regularly (several times a day)!

Well, good antivirues wont't do anything other than me, they're just quicker with sorting out.  
But they won't laugh at you as I do. That would mean less fun to me -- I think I can't do that ;-)

> Don't be mad at me, everyone has their own work.

That is not work. That is what scumbags do. Pissing other people off. But you are hiding behind proxy servers
and think you cannot be tracked back. Until you start making mistakes. Have fun hiding there.
Hope you loose a leg scumbag.
