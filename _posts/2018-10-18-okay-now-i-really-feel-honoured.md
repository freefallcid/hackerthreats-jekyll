            <pre class="highlight"><code>Hello!

My nickname in darknet is ephrayim38.
I hacked this mailbox more than six months ago, through it I infected your operating system with a virus (trojan) created by me and have been monitoring you for a long time.

So, your password from child@death.prince-of-darkness.org is *********

Even if you changed the password after that - it does not matter, my virus intercepted all the caching data on your computer
and automatically saved access for me.

I have access to all your accounts, social networks, email, browsing history.
Accordingly, I have the data of all your contacts, files from your computer, photos and videos.

I was most struck by the intimate content sites that you occasionally visit.
You have a very wild imagination, I tell you!

During your pastime and entertainment there, I took screenshot through the camera of your device, synchronizing with what you are watching.
Oh my god! You are so funny and excited!

I think that you do not want all your contacts to get these files, right?
If you are of the same opinion, then I think that $861 is quite a fair price to destroy the dirt I created.

Send the above amount on my BTC wallet (bitcoin): 1EZS92K4xJbymDLwG4F7PNF5idPE62e9XY
As soon as the above amount is received, I guarantee that the data will be deleted, I do not need it.

Otherwise, these files and history of visiting sites will get all your contacts from your device.
Also, I'll send to everyone your contact access to your email and access logs, I have carefully saved it!

Since reading this letter you have 48 hours!
After your reading this message, I'll receive an automatic notification that you have seen the letter.

I hope I taught you a good lesson.
Do not be so nonchalant, please visit only to proven resources, and don't enter your passwords anywhere!
Good luck!</code></pre>

Now, just let's cut that into smaller pieces and answer this one one-by-one.

You have not hacked that mailbox more than six months ago. That mailbox is offline for ages now.
I re-bought that domain last year to get mail like yours or other **important stuff** that I might
have missed otherwise...

> So, your password from child@death.prince-of-darkness.org is *********

Tell me an actually used mail account.

Okay, so you compromised my "caching data" and saved access on my machine, right?

> I have access to all your accounts, social networks, email, browsing history.
> Accordingly, I have the data of all your contacts, files from your computer, photos and videos.

Okay, then my internet usage would have been dramatically high, because that would mean that my computer practically
uploaded tons of terabytes to your computer.

First of all: you want me to trust you? A ~~hacker~~ script kiddie? Really?
Second: I sent moar money to all your bitcoin wallets -- haven't you got that already??!elf

Yes. Because you saved my "caching data", right?

> I hope I taught you a good lesson.
> Do not be so nonchalant, please visit only to proven resources, and don't enter your passwords anywhere!

You taught me a lesson. I will never again rebuy an old domain. It was funny somehow, but not really worth it.
Look, I'm still writing in here to create a response to that junk mail. Eating up minutes of my life. :(

> Good luck!

Yeah thanks. Though I guess you might need that more than me...
