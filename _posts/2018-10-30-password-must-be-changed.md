I'm a programmer who cracked your email account and device about half year ago.
You entered a password on one of the insecure site you visited, and I catched it.
Your password from child@death.prince-of-darkness.org on moment of crack: *********

Of course you can will change your password, or already made it.
But it doesn't matter, my rat software update it every time.

Please don't try to contact me or find me, it is impossible, since I sent you an email from your email account.

Through your e-mail, I uploaded malicious code to your Operation System.
I saved all of your contacts with friends, colleagues, relatives and a complete history of visits to the Internet resources.
Also I installed a rat software on your device and long tome spying for you.

You are not my only victim, I usually lock devices and ask for a ransom.
But I was struck by the sites of intimate content that you very often visit.

I am in shock of your reach fantasies! Wow! I've never seen anything like this!
I did not even know that SUCH content could be so exciting!

So, when you had fun on intime sites (you know what I mean!)
I made screenshot with using my program from your camera of yours device.
After that, I jointed them to the content of the currently viewed site.

Will be funny when I send these photos to your contacts! And if your relatives see it?
BUT I'm sure you don't want it. I definitely would not want to ...

I will not do this if you pay me a little amount.
I think $889 is a nice price for it!

I accept only Bitcoins.
My BTC wallet: 1BncH5WxBSYJ6mmcJC9bCRxQ6Z1evvtRxk

If you have difficulty with this - Ask Google "how to make a payment on a bitcoin wallet". It's easy.
After receiving the above amount, all your data will be immediately removed automatically.
My virus will also will be destroy itself from your operating system.

My Trojan have auto alert, after this email is looked, I will be know it!

You have 2 days (48 hours) for make a payment.
If this does not happen - all your contacts will get crazy shots with your dirty life!
And so that you do not obstruct me, your device will be locked (also after 48 hours)

Do not take this frivolously! This is the last warning!
Various security services or antiviruses won't help you for sure (I have already collected all your data).

Here are the recommendations of a professional:
Antiviruses do not help against modern malicious code. Just do not enter your passwords on unsafe sites!

I hope you will be prudent.
Bye.</code></pre>

Okay, let's have a closer look at it.

> I'm a programmer who cracked your email account and device about half year ago.
> You entered a password on one of the insecure site you visited, and I catched it.
> Your password from child@death.prince-of-darkness.org on moment of crack: *********

Crack sounds like something that breaks something. Catching a password is not much 'cracky' isn't it?

> Of course you can will change your password, or already made it.
> But it doesn't matter, my rat software update it every time.

Yes of course I can will have changed it. I also talked to your RAT software and we finally
complied to not update that password.

> Please don't try to contact me or find me, it is impossible, since I sent you an email from your email account.

It is de facto not _impossible_. It's not economic to do so.
And finding someone just to punch his face is also not worthwhile. But, nonetheless, your argument is not logical.
The fact, that you sent me an email with my own address as sender and receiver is not the reason you think.
Also that email address is taken offline for years now. There's no physical way for sending an email off of that account.

> You are not my only victim, I usually lock devices and ask for a ransom.
> But I was struck by the sites of intimate content that you very often visit.

I suggest you lock devices. Your chance of getting money will raise dramatically, believe me.
By the way, I'm also very shocked of the content of that sites that I visit.

> So, when you had fun on intime sites (you know what I mean!)
> I made screenshot with using my program from your camera of yours device.

Another suggestion of mine. Have you ever thought about making films? Cutter might be the job that
you're looking for.

> Will be funny when I send these photos to your contacts! And if your relatives see it?
> BUT I'm sure you don't want it. I definitely would not want to ...

And I thought my english is bad. Damn, look at you...

> I will not do this if you pay me a little amount.
> I think $889 is a nice price for it!

So you think $889 is a little amount, huh? You should definitly stay at school. Some more maths would be great.

What I hate the most on you: you send blackmail scum to people and want them to pay you about a months salary.
You are a sponge. Not a tiny bit better than a big company. Whenever we meet on a street, you better are
prepared for your worst nightmare.

> Do not take this frivolously! This is the last warning!

Of how many last warnings?

> Here are the recommendations of a professional:

Thanks for that comment. It's not more than that and for sure not an opinion of a professional. A skript-kiddie
is what we call you here.

## Conclusion

I will not pay you. Not one fucking cent. All you can get from me is a rough punch in your fucking face---just before
I break your bones.
