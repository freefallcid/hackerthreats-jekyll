I found a similar email in my inbox today. Highly marked as spam. I was very surprised
that I got that email because of that high spam-score.

```
Hi, dear user of death.prince-of-darkness.org
We have installed one RAT software into you device.
For this moment your email account is hacked (see on "from address", I messaged you from your account).
Your password for child@death.prince-of-darkness.org: *********

I have downloaded all confidential information from your system and I got some more evidence.
The most interesting moment that I have discovered are videos records where you masturbating.

I posted my virus on porn site, and then you installed it on your operation system.
When you clicked the button Play on porn video, at that moment my trojan was downloaded to your device.
After installation, your front camera shoots video every time you masturbate, in addition, the software is synchronized with the video you choose.

For the moment, the software has collected all your contact information from social networks and email addresses.
If you need to erase all of your collected data, send me $800 in BTC (crypto currency).
This is my Bitcoin wallet: 13cyEdT7kyH2f4j9xchvDGhv1o64MYNLUS
You have 48 hours after reading this letter.

After your transaction I will erase all your data.
Otherwise, I will send video with your pranks to all your colleagues and friends!!!

And henceforth be more careful!
Please visit only secure sites!
Bye!
```

As you can see, the used Bitcoin wallet is:

- [13cyEdT7kyH2f4j9xchvDGhv1o64MYNLUS](https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports/13cyEdT7kyH2f4j9xchvDGhv1o64MYNLUS)

Once again, they sent an old password along. Obviosly the sender hopes that I remember the password and pay the wanted amount of bitcoins.

In the end those emails would normally not get delivered. I was curious about how much spam I would get on that old domain -- I did not get disappointed here ;-)

Here have an insight into a stripped version of the mail headers:
