I get spam mails regularly. Usually those emails contain ads for pills or money or some nubian prince -- but then I
got blackmailed with an old password of mine. Those mails usually wanted me to transfer approx $800
to a bitcoin wallet.

People that use the modern internet to confuse older and/or non-internet-affine people to steal their
money should be punched in the face. 

*Oh hey, this website is for you assholes ;-)*
